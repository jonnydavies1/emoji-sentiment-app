# emoji-sentiment-app
emoji sentiment app
This simple implementation creates an embeddable app that displays the five emojis and logs the corresponding points to the console when clicked. You can further customize the appearance and behavior of the app, such as sending the points to a backend server for storage and analysis.

To embed this app in another website, you can create an iframe and link to the HTML file:

<iframe src="path/to/your/emoji-sentiment-app.html" width="100%" height="100" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Replace path/to/your/emoji-sentiment-app.html with the actual path to the HTML file containing your app.
